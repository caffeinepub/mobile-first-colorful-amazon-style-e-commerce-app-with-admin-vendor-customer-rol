  "summary": "Diff adds `frontend/vite.config.ts` with a `define` shim for `process.env.II_URL` and adds `frontend/tsconfig.node.json`. It also updates `frontend/DEPLOYMENT.md` with environment variable guidance and verification steps. However, `frontend/tsconfig.json` (explicitly required) is not present in the diff, and there are unrelated frontend utility/documentation-summary changes not requested by the BuildRequest.",

        "ADDED FILES list: frontend/tsconfig.node.json, frontend/vite.config.ts (no frontend/tsconfig.json shown)",
