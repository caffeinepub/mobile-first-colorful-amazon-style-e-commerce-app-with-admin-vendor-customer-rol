  "summary": "Diff implements substantial UI colorfulness and gradient/tinted-surface enhancements across multiple storefront and portal pages, and adds shared status styling with a reusable OrderStatusBadge. However, the requested regenerated image assets are not evidenced in the diff summary, and the palette appears to be expanded beyond the stated primary/secondary/accent set via new chart colors.",

    {
      "requirement": "Regenerate/replace the specified marketing and UI image assets with more saturated/colorful versions (hero banners 1-3, category icon sprite, trust badges).",
      "reason": "The diff summary only shows code changes referencing new '-colorful' hero banner paths, but does not show any added/modified files under frontend/public/assets/generated for the requested PNG outputs (including category-icons-sprite-colorful and trust-badges-set-colorful).",

      "reason": "BuildRequest constrains work to the already-defined palette; adding extra chart tokens appears to introduce additional colors not requested.",
