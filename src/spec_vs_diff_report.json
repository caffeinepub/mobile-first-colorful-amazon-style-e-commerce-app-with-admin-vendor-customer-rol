However, there is insufficient diff evidence that the City dropdown is restricted to exactly Kanpur/Unnao, and the global theme palette includes blue/purple despite the non-blue/non-purple palette requirement. Additionally, several existing non-Home storefront/admin/vendor pages were restyled beyond the requested scope.",
