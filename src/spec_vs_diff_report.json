  "summary": "Most UI theming work appears implemented: new global CSS variables/palette in index.css, reusable marketplace-card styling, a PrimaryCtaButton wrapper for gradient CTAs with tap-scale, and multiple page/component updates (products, categories page, hero slider, admin/vendor dashboards) to use the new theme. However, some requirements are not fully evidenced (notably Home page category cards being square gradient tiles per REQ-4), and several unrelated functional/feature changes are indicated in the diff summaries.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Revise category card UI (including any category-card grids on the Home page) to use colorful gradient square cards with large icons and a tap animation, while preserving navigation behavior and category color mapping.",
      "reason": "CategoriesPage shows square gradient/icon cards, but the HomePage category section in the diff appears to use tall rectangular cards (\"relative h-44\") rather than square/near-square tiles. This suggests the Home page category card grid portion of the requirement is not met.",

      "description": "New/expanded URL parameter + sessionStorage persistence utilities (including handling hash routing) not related to marketplace theming.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest is strictly UI theming and explicitly avoids new non-UI features; these utilities are unrelated to applying a marketplace theme.",

        "frontend/src/utils/urlParams.ts"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Shopping cart behavior changed to a read-only cart view (quantity update/remove actions removed).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest is UI-only and explicitly lists non-goals as adding/changing marketplace features; removing cart actions changes functionality rather than styling.",
      "evidence": [

      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Checkout page changes adding payment placeholder and altering order placement fields (e.g., city field, commissionApplied: false).",
      "reason": "Request prohibits backend/data model/feature changes and is focused on UI presentation; these sound like workflow/logic changes beyond theming.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt"

    },
    {
      "description": "Product detail page logic refactor (fetch all products and find by ID) plus enhanced carousel controls and new pricing surfaces/badges beyond global styling.",
      "reason": "While UI improvements are in-scope, changing data-fetching strategy/logic is not requested and risks functional regression; the request emphasizes keeping existing functionality unchanged.",

    },
    {
      "description": "Customer profile page behavior changed to read-only and addition of new role hook usage (useGetCallerRole) and enum extraction logic.",
